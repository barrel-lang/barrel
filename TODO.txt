FEATURES:
- for loops
- list operations
- Fried notation for quotations 
- primrec, binrec, genrec, treerec, linrec, monoidal versions and a bunch of joy combinators
- Copy CJam functions http://foldr.moe/cjam.pdf, and Joy functions https://hypercubed.github.io/joy/html/html-manual.html
- Ending }, ] and " are optional
- Local bindings which pop values off the stack and assign them to names and a generalized peek, which doesnt pop.
- Custom Encoding for unicode
- MATRICES
- DICTIONARIES (`[[3"fizz"][5"buzz"][7"buzz"]]`)
- ^^ have an operator that takes a number and tuplefies that many elements. 
so [3"fizz"5"buzz"7"buzz"3(OP)] = [[3"fizz"][5"buzz"][7"buzz"]]. Even better, maybe make it wrap in quote by default.
- Have the functions `first` and `second` that get the first and second elements of a quotation.
- More IO operators
- Boolean Operators (AND, OR, NOT, ETC)
- BETTER ERROR MESSAGES
- implicit inputs like in osabie

FUTURE:
- function that takes in a number and puts the top n elements in a quotation
- conversion operators
- Use 「 」 for quote or function brackets
- Version of map for strings

BUGS:
- FIX IF EXPRESSIONS URGNET
